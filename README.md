# Overview

Landing page created as third project for Udacity front-end web development certification.

# Features

This landing page allows for creating and removing page sections dynamically by clicking two buttons in the top left of the page. It also has a dynamical navigation menu to the right of the page that adjusts automatically to the newly created sections. Furthermore, when a section is scrolled into the viewport, it is given the active class, which alters its styling. Also, the active section is highlighted in the navigation menu.
